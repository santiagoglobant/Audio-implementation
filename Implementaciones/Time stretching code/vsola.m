% Implementation of the variable parameter  synchronised overlap add VSOLA algorithm 
% This implementation makes use of the standard SOLA algorithm (Rocus and Wilgus, ICASSP 1986) and some efficient paramter settings for the SOLA algorithm (Dorran, Lawlor and Coyle, ICASSP 2003) and (Dorran, Lawlor and Coyle, DAFX 2003)
% Given an input, ip, the longest likely pitch period, P, and  and a time scale modification factor, tsm_factor, return an output, op, that is a time scaled version of the input. The synthesis_overlap_size is the length, in samples of the lowest likely fundametal period of the input.
% for speech synthesis_overlap_size is set to (16/1000)*fs samples and for music synthesis_overlap_size is typically set to (20/1000)*fs samples 
%
% As with all time-domain algorithms this will only work well for signals which have a strong periodic element. For more complex audio you should use a frequency-domain implementation like the phase vocoder
